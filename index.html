          Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural
          intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study
          of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its
          chance of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to
          describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as
          "learning" and "problem solving", however this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.
          AI applications include advanced web search engines (i.e. Google), recommendation systems (used by
          YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars
          (e.g. Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.
